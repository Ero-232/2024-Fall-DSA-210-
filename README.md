# 2024-Fall-DSA-210-

This is my 2024 Fall Semester's DSA 210 project. 

My aim with this project is to analyze my expenses from the period October 1st to December 30th and evaluate the times I make a transaction, to see whether there is a correlation in any of the parameters.

For this, I have extracted my bank account transactions of Akbank, using this bank's mobile application, and exported as a .csv file to be used as a dataset in my project. Then, I have hidden the personal information, such as the current balance and incomes. I used a nobalance.py script for this. After that, I am going to pick out and group the when, how much, and to where is the expenses are made, and group them accordingly.

To portray the dataset with various illustration tools, like when and what time are the most transactions are made, what are the most prominent expense sources and so on; I am gointg to use python to illustrate and plot the data, and compare between the various aspects of the transactions. Then, I will try to get insights about the charts and data tables.
