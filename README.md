# 2024-Fall-DSA-210-

This is my 2024 Fall Semester's DSA 210 project. 

My aim with this project is to analyze my expenses from the period October 1st to November 30th. For this, I have extracted my bank account transactions of Akbank, using this bank's mobile application, and exported as a .csv file. I have hidden the personal information, such as the current balance and incomes. 

My plan is to portray the dataset with various illustration tools, like when and what time are the most transactions are made, what are the most prominent expense sources and so on. In this project, I am gointg to use python to illustrate and plot the data, and compare between the various aspects of the transactions.
